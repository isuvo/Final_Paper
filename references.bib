    abstract = {Usage of Deep Learning (DL) methods is ubiquitous. It is common in the DL/Artificial Intelligence domain to use 3rd party software. TensorFlow is one of the most popular Machine Learning (ML) platforms. Every software product is a subject to security failures which often result from software vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on threats related to 6 common types of threats in TensorFlow implementation. We identify them using Common Weakness Enumeration. We analyze more than 100 vulnerability instances. We focus on vulnerabilities’ severity, impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, as well as possible results of exploitation. We also use Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). The results show that a majority of vulnerabilities are caused by missing/incorrect checking statements, however some fixes require more advanced algorithmic changes. Static Analysis Tools tested in our study show low effectiveness in detecting known vulnerabilities in TensorFlow, but we provide some recommendations based on the obtained alerts to improve overall code quality. Further analysis of vulnerabilities helped us to understand and characterize different vulnerability types and provide a set of observations. We believe that these observations can be useful for the creators of new static analysis tools as a source of inspiration and to build the test cases. We also aim to draw the programmers’ attention to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in deep learning applications and a low effectiveness of automatic tools to find software vulnerabilities in such products.}

abstract = {While deep learning has shown a great potential in various domains, the lack of transparency has limited its application in security or safety-critical areas. Existing research has attempted to develop explanation techniques to provide interpretable explanations for each classification decision. Unfortunately, current methods are optimized for non-security tasks ( e.g., image analysis). Their key assumptions are often violated in security applications, leading to a poor explanation fidelity. In this paper, we propose LEMNA, a high-fidelity explanation method dedicated for security applications. Given an input data sample, LEMNA generates a small set of interpretable features to explain how the input sample is classified. The core idea is to approximate a local area of the complex deep learning decision boundary using a simple interpretable model. The local interpretable model is specially designed to (1) handle feature dependency to better work with security applications ( e.g., binary code analysis); and (2) handle nonlinear local boundaries to boost explanation fidelity. We evaluate our system using two popular deep learning applications in security (a malware classifier, and a function start detector for binary reverse-engineering). Extensive evaluations show that LEMNA's explanation has a much higher fidelity level compared to existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate practical use cases of LEMNA to help machine learning developers to validate model behavior, troubleshoot classification errors, and automatically patch the errors of the target models.},

	abstract = {Causal correlation data over the equipment spot-inspection operation and maintenance (O&M) records and fault investigation sheets potentially reflect the state related to the causal effect of equipment failures. Various factors influence equipment failures, making it difficult to effectively analyze the main cause of the problems. Mining and leveraging these causal data from the equipment spot inspection records will undoubtedly significantly improve the root cause analysis of the fault in the O&M system. Hence, this paper introduces causal knowledge in equipment fault O&M for the first time and proposes to exploit causal knowledge for enhancing root cause analysis of equipment spot inspection failures. Specifically, an equipment fault O&M knowledge graph with causal knowledge called CausalKG is constructed to provide knowledge support for the causal analysis of faults. That is, CausalKG consists of spot-inspection knowledge graph (SIKG) and causal relationship knowledge (CRK) in equipment fault O&M. Further, a CausalKG-ALBERT knowledge reasoning model is designed. The model transforms CausalKG into network embeddings based on relational graph convolutional networks. In turn, it combines the Q&A mechanism of the language model ALBERT to mine the root cause knowledge of equipment failures. The case study confirms that incorporating the CRK is more effective than directly using the SIKG for causality reasoning; The model can fully use causal relationship knowledge to enhance the reliability of root cause analysis. This method is valuable to help engineers strengthen their causal analysis capabilities in preventive equipment maintenance.}
